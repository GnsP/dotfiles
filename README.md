# Dot Files

Add all files in ./home/ folder to your local home directory (~/).  

## Tools/Configurations provided

#### Vim
To update vim:  
 * Open Vim (obviously not Vi)
 * Type ':PluginUpdate'.
 * NOTE: If that doesn't work, you'll probably have to clone vundle
 in ~/.vim/bundle/ directory. Then repeat ':PluginUpdate' to get all
 other plugins. :)

#### Bash
Bash should work right outta the box.  
Boy oh boy it looks amazing. Enjoy :)

#### Lynx
No configuration needed.

#### Top
Awesome interface to top command without any hassle.

#### Mutt
You'll have to add your username and password to make it work.

#### Ack
Some small custom configurations to the mighty ack tool.

### Recommendation
I'd recommend you to use tool like homeshick to clone this repo:
```sh
homeshick clone https://github.com/shubhamchaudhary/dotfiles.git
```
